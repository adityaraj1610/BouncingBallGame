🎾 Bouncing Ball Game

A simple animated bouncing ball game built using Python and Pygame. This project demonstrates basic animation and collision detection techniques in a 2D graphical environment.

🚀 Features

- Bouncing red ball with collision detection against the window borders
- Smooth animation at 60 FPS
- Clean and minimal implementation using Pygame

📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bouncing-ball-game.git
   cd bouncing-ball-game
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python Bouncing\ Ball\ Game.py
   ```

🧠 How It Works

- The ball is represented by a circle with a fixed radius.
- On each frame, the ball's position is updated based on its speed.
- When the ball hits the edge of the window, its direction is reversed to simulate a bounce.

✏️ Customization

You can tweak the following parameters in the code:
- `ball_speed`: Change speed and direction
- `ball_radius`: Change size of the ball
- `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`: Change the screen size
- `RED`: Modify ball color
